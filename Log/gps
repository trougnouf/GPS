Battery:
need 2.8-2.9V
 LFP has 25% less capacity than other lithium batteries, The major differences between LFP batteries and ordinary lithium batteries are that LFP batteries do not have safety concerns such as overheating and explosion, that they have 4 to 5 times longer cycle lifetimes than the lithium batteries 8 to 10 times higher discharge power and 30 to 50% less weight.


use switcher (linear regulator are not efficient, they use the same current so higher power

TouchScreen
	ADC
	channels = how many sources, multiplexed
	Touch screens are prohibitively expensive. A simple mass-produced touch screen overlay made for the Nintendo DS can be obtained for $8.00, more than the LCD screen itself, and the price skyrockets for more specific units such as one that would fit our inexpensive 1.44" screen. A set of simple, inexpensive buttons will be used to control this device with unmatched precision.
