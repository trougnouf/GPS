This is a readme file for the GN3S-Linux driver. The driver is only compatible with certain configurations of the SiGe SE4110L GPS front-end combined with the Cypress FX2LP USB transceiver.


The package consists of the following parts:

fx2-programmer 		Used for programming RAM and EEPROM on the USB chip

gn3s-firmware.ihx	Firmware for the FX2 chip (Intel HEX format for RAM)
gn3s-firmware.iic	Firmware for the FX2 chip (I2C format for EEPROM)

gn3s-full			The host program capable of streaming IF data from the 							SE4110L, in real-time, through the FX2 chip

Included is also the full source code to build the files described above.


QUICKSTART GUIDE


If the board is already programmed with firmware in EEPROM it will automatically boot that firmware when connected (powered) to a computer.

Data can then be collected using the "gn3s-full" program:

To collect 32 MB of data to the file data.bin
	./gn3s-full -s 32 -o data.bin


ADVANCED OPTIONS


The VID/PID is 0x16c0/0x072f by default, to use a device with a different ID:
	./gn3s-full -s 32 -o data.bin -d 0x1781 -p 0x0b38

By using the -c <config> option more advanced options can be selected.

	config takes a hex argument consisting of 1 hex character
		0x"DPSM" where each bit represents
			M set (0x1) = stream to memory then dump to disk
			S set (0x2) = pack samples into bytes (4 or 8 samples / byte)
			P set (0x4) = subsample (without filtering) by a factor of 3
			D set (0x8) = decimate from 2 bits (SGN-MAG) to 1 bit (SGN)

M Option

The host software supports two different operating modes, stream to disk (default) or stream to memory (-m flag)
	./gn3s-full -s 32 -o data.bin -c 0x1

WARNING: The -m flag should be used with caution since allocating very large amounts of memory can cause problems...

S option

Simply stores every third sample effectively changing the sampling rate and IF as:

Old sampling rate = 16367667 Hz
Standard IF       = 4123968  Hz

New sampling rate = 5455889  Hz
New IF            = 1331921  Hz

P option

Samples are packed low to high such as [s3 s2 s1 s0] for 2 bit samples in one byte.

D option

Simply decimates the data from 2 bit SGN-MAG to 1 bit SGN. 


HINT:

To achieve better performance, especially useful when collecting large data sets and experiencing buffer overruns, the "nice" feature can be used to increase the priority of the gn3s-full program

	sudo nice -n -20 ./gn3s-full -s 1000 -o data.bin


PROGRAMMING THE FX2 CHIP


To program the board temporarily (will reset when disconnected):

	./fx2-programmer 0x16c0 0x072f set 0xe600 1
	./fx2-programmer 0x16c0 0x072f program ../firmware/gn3s-firmware.ihx
	./fx2-programmer 0x16c0 0x072f set 0xe600 0

To check the current EEPROM configuration:

	./fx2-programmer 0x16c0 0x072f read_vendor

If the first byte is x the device will boot as:

x = 0x00 	default (Cypress VID: 0x04b4 PID: 0x8613)
x = 0xC0	VID/PID as specified by the next 4 bytes in EEPROM
x = 0xC2	boot from EEPROM, VID/PID will be specified by the firmware

To program only VID/PID to EEPROM:

	./fx2-programmer 0x04b4 0x8613 program_vendor 0x16c0 0x072f

To write firmware in .iic format to EEPROM:

	./fx2-programmer 0x16c0 0x072f program_fw ../firmware/gn3s-firmware.iic

NOTE: This operation requires a file called serial.txt in the same directory! The file serial.txt should ONLY contain a serial number 5 DIGITS in length, such as "10000" (plain text without the double quotes). After each use of "program_fw" the serial number will be increased by one to allow programming of multiple devices.
The USB-IF (who maintains the USB standard) states that each USB device must have a valid VID/PID and a unique serial number.
