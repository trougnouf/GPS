Revisions
  1.17  Added data bit recording and write to file (this feature is not completely
  debugged), corrected error in satpos_almanac, Thanks Tak! Also corrected an
  error in navmess, thanks Goetz!  Also added an indication on page 1 which
  interface (ISA or PCI) is being used and the almanac page number.

  1.16
  Addes #ifdefs to allow compilation by DJGPP.  Setup use of PCI interface
  Modified almanac read logic to check when a new almanac is available

  1.15
  Added more integrity checking into the data bit synchronization in the pull-in
  state.  Instead of just checking the change in phase and checking that it is
  very close to a +-90 to -+90 transition it also stores the last 20 ms sign
  values and they must all be the same and opposite of the transitioned ms sign
  before declaring the edge of a data bit.  Modified parity check algorithm to
  be more efficient. Also made constants for number of channels and register
  address and data address.
  1.14
  Fixed error in nmea checksum routine.  Added another display page and
  supporting data structure to show parity errors in navigation message
  decoding.
  1.13
  Made mods to get ICP working better, trying to use just the last 0.1 second
  of carrier phase data.  Phil Bender added NMEA serial port messages (needs
  some more work, see files serport.cpp, nmea.cpp, fwinter.cpp). Additional
  entries at the bottom of rcvr_par.dat are used to set up the NMEA messages.
  Adapted program so it can compile under Borland (#ifdef BCPP) or Microsoft
  Visual CPP (#ifdef VCPP)  Also split up the program into library components
  to make it more modular (see GPS_ISR.CPP and NAVFIX.CPP)
  1.12
  Removed some of the ephemeris checks that were causing the rejection of
  valid ephemeris messages and also caused it not to accept ephemeris
  messages from a constellation simulator.  Fixed up the 1 second data bit
  ambiguities to recover measurements that previously had been thrown out.
  1.11
  Cleaned up the display when a satellite is removed from consideration
  Fixed an ephemeris management problem that caused occasional use of the
  ephemeris from the wrong satellite
  Modified the ephemeris mgmt to check IODE and IODC to decide when
  to grab a new ephemeris + ephemeris integrity checks
  Improved the almanac page redundancy check
  Moved Pr, dPR, Tropo and Iono into the main channel data structure
  Set up default iono parameters when ion_utc.dat not available
  Added a debug output that provides raw measurements data and ephemeris
  which provides more processing capability than pseudorange & delta pseudorange
  Fully implemented the GPSRCVR.LOG output options
  Added the option in RCVR_PAR.DAT to use CTL (carrier tracking loop) or
  ICP (integrated carrier phase) data for velocity computations (ICP seems
  to have bias problems)
  1.10
  Made the read of rcvr_par not so picky as long as the text field has no spaces
  Fixed a problem in CMatrix with the Borland 5.02 compiler
  Re-aligned column titles for pages 2-4
  1.09
  Corrected hot start problem
  Hooked up almanac data type check
  Started using Aberto's matrix libraries for DOP calculations
  Minor changes in pream
  Got rid of tmax in nav_fix
  Added more mesaurement integrity checks in nav_fix
  Added header and tdop to display
  1.08
  Corrected tracking loop bias problem (I hope!)
  Corrected code loop doppler correction constant
  1.07
  Added check for bit sync in pull-in, must be set to transition to track
  Extended pull-in to end of data bit to reduce transients when going into track
  Added integrated carrier phase processing for velocity
  Improved GPS time alignment mode (for any nav fix rate)
  Corrected iono correction computations (again)
  Corrected tropo correction sign
  Reduced debug arrays to reduce code size
  Added two new display pages, iono & tropo, and pseudorange and delta
  pseudorange
  Not used yet but getting set up to use Alberto Perez's matrix libraries
  1.06
  Added new format for Kalman.dat
  corrected iono correction computations
  Added more comments
  1.05
  Improved Code tracking loop
  Added GPS time alignment mode
  Added time zone input from rcvr_par.dat
  Corrected errors in satpos_ephemeris
  Corrected current.eph file format
  1.04
  Corrections in Gpsfuncs
  Added new display page for nav message HOW and TOW
  1.03
  New preamble routine
  Added Carrier phase aiding
