To install (build) the necessary files:

HOST PROGRAM:

cd gn3s-linux/src/host
make clean all install

FX2-PROGRAMMER:

cd gn3s-linux/src/fx2-programmer-plus
make all install

These operations will install the binaries in the "bin" directory.  

The firmware is already built for the 8051 MCU on the FX2 chip! It should only be rebuilt if it has been modified (see note at the bottom of this document).


FIRMWARE:

cd gn3s-linux/src/firmware/lib
make clean all
cd ../src
make clean all install

The firmware will be installed in the "firmware" directory.

NOTE: There is a Cypress tool which converts firmware in .ihx format to .iic for EEPROM uploads, however this tool is for Windows only.
